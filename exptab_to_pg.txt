Dear David,

I didn't get to do any more work on DBI-Link.

One piece of information that I thought might be worth sharing though,
in particular with respect to your type mapping ideas, is how to
translate Oracle data type to PostgreSQL data types. It requires some
insight in both worlds:

Numeric types:
==============

Oracle's BINARY_FLOAT corresponds to PostgreSQL's REAL.

Oracle's BINARY_DOUBLE corresponds to PostgreSQL's DOUBLE PRECISION.

Oracle does not have an integer data type, there is only NUMBER
which corresponds to PostgreSQL's NUMERIC.

If you want to be smart, you can translate Oracle NUMBERs without decimal
fractions ($column->{DECIMAL_DIGITS} == 0) to INTEGER
if $column->{COLUMN_SIZE} <= 9 and to BIGINT if $column->{COLUMN_SIZE} <= 18

Date/Time:
==========

Oracle does not have a data type that would correspond to PostgreSQL's DATE.

Oracle's DATE is a timestamp with seconds precision.

On the other hand, PostgreSQL's TIMESTAMP(n) WITH TIME ZONE does not
contain time zone information, it is an UTC timestamp.

Still I would map Oracle's DATE and TIMESTAMP(n) to PostgreSQL's
TIMESTAMP(n) WITHOUT TIME ZONE.

Oracle's TIMESTAMP(n) WITH TIME ZONE and TIMESTAMP(n) WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE
are best represented as PostgreSQL's TIMESTAMP(n) WITH TIME ZONE,
although time zone information will be lost.

Oracle does not have anything corresponding to PostgreSQL's TIME or
TIME WITH TIMEZONE.

Both Oracle's INTERVAL DAY(n) TO SECOND(m) and INTERVAL YEAR(n) TO MONTH
can be represented by PostgreSQL's INTERVAL.

Binary:
=======

Oracle's RAW(n), LONG RAW, BLOB and BFILE can be represented as BYTEA,
although RAW(n) will be rendered in hex and would need extra processing.

String:
=======

Oracle's CHAR(n) and NCHAR(n) correspond to PostgreSQL's CHARACTER(n).

Oracle's VARCHAR2(n) and NVARCHAR2(n) correspond to PostgreSQL's
CHARACTER VARYING(n).

Oracle's LONG, CLOB and NCLOB data types correspond to PostgreSQL's TEXT.

The text formats of some of these Oracle data types are influenced by
session parameters/environment variables:

- The first character of NLS_NUMERIC_CHARACTERS will be used as decimal separator.
- NLS_DATE_FORMAT will determine how DATE values will be converted to strings.
- NLS_TIMESTAMP_FORMAT will determine the representation of TIMESTAMP(n).
- NLS_TIMESTAMP_TZ_FORMAT will determine how TIMESTAMP(n) WITH [LOCAL] TIME ZONE si displayed.

Yours,
Laurenz Albe
